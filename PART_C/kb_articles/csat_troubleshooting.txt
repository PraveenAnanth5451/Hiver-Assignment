Title: Why CSAT Scores May Not Appear in Hiver

CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) scores in Hiver are generated when customers submit feedback through CSAT surveys sent after conversations are resolved. If the CSAT score is not appearing, there are a few possible causes.

Common reasons why CSAT may not appear:

CSAT surveys are disabled
Go to the Admin Panel → CSAT Settings and ensure that CSAT surveys are turned ON.

Conversations are not being marked as Resolved
CSAT surveys are only sent when a conversation moves to the Resolved status.
If conversations remain Open/Pending, no survey is sent.

Email replies are not reaching the CSAT mailbox
Ensure the CSAT response address is correctly configured and has permission to receive replies.

Recent responses may still be syncing
CSAT reports usually refresh within a few minutes. During peak usage, this may take slightly longer.

Survey delivery issues
If customers do not receive the survey email, the CSAT score will not be generated.
Review your email deliverability or spam settings.

If CSAT still does not appear, regenerate the CSAT configuration or contact Hiver support for verification of survey logs.
